      Hi, I'm Steven Scaffidi, and I'm a full stack developer living in California. One of my major goals is to help support small businesses, and this goal is what led me to create Tela Edge. Tela is a small beach town in Honduras where my mom grew up. I also spent a good part of my childhood in Tela, which is why I decided to call my company Tela Edge. Creating web-based applications is my passion, and I'm constantly learning new languages, coding techniques, and frameworks to help make applications that are modern, fast, and secure. My MBA helps me to create individualized web-based applications based on each company's business needs, and my mission is to design software that is easy to use and valuable to each customer.
      And when I'm not coding, I love hanging out with my wife, Christie, and my dog, Maj√©.
      Check out my GitHub profile or my portfolio to see my latest work, and if you need help creating a web-based application or a website, please contact me.
